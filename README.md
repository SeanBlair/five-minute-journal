# My five minute journal

For reminding yourself of some helpful things, which can result in a more comfortable state of mind.

This is a simple application I created to practice using the React tool.

## Requirements

To try out the app locally, you need Node.js and git installed on your environment.

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/SeanBlair/five-minute-journal.git
    $ cd five-minute-journal
    $ npm install

## Start

    $ npm start

## Languages and tools

### JavaScript

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for efficiently and intuitively creating a user interface.
* [immutability-helper](https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper) for updating a copy of the application's state object without mutating the original.
